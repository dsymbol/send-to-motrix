### FAQ:

#### Q: Why not capture all downloads and send them to Motrix?
A: I find using a download manager for every little file pointless, hence why I made it send rather than capture.

#### Q: How to check RPC server status?
A: Run netstat and look for the 16800 port status.

#### Q: Which port does the RPC server use on Motrix?
A: 16800
